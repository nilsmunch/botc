# Blood on the Clocktower PDFs

https://bloodontheclocktower.com/

This repo contains the PDFs for the "Blood on the Clocktower" social deduction game.
The repo's goal is to provide a single collection of relevant docs hosted in an
accessible way. I make no guarantees to keep it up-to-date with changes to the official
rules, but I'll try.

Some of the PDFs come from the game developers, some come from [community efforts](http://bignose.whitetree.org/projects/botc/diy/) to
make print-and-play easier. All of the design is by [The Pandemonium Institute](https://www.thepandemoniuminstitute.com/).

I've modelled various parts for 3d printing in the [parts](./parts/) directory. There are various cylindrical tokens,
shrouds, bits boxes and cutters designed to help you cut neat circles of the correct size out of paper and felt.
See this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT7ckgz8vcobaxTT2ZPutclZR1B4fdxIY) for details.

The developers have voiced support for print-and-play, so I'm hoping this repo will not
cause grief.
