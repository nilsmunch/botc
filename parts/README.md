# Printable tokens

This directory contains 3d printable tokens for use in BotC. They're sized to suit the
various tokens in ../unofficial_pdfs/. I produced these models in OpenSCAD, and I've
exported them to STL.

By my count you'll need:

life_token x 23
character_token x 103
vote_token x 20
effect_token x 125
alignment_token x 22
pip_token x 34
info_tag x 12
shroud x 18
