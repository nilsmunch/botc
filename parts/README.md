# Printable tokens

This directory contains 3d printable tokens for use in BotC. They're sized to suit the
various tokens in [the unofficial PDFs](../unofficial_pdfs/). I produced these models in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/), and I've
exported them to STL.

By my count you'll need:

| Piece | Count |
| ----- | ----- |
| life_token | 23 |
| character_token | 103 |
| vote_token | 20 |
| effect_token | 125 |
| alignment_token | 22 |
| pip_token | 34 |
| info_tag | 12 |
| shroud | 18 |
